# Exoveless UI Kit

A set of React/Next.js UI components and primitives that are documented through Storybook 10.

## Storybook

1. Install deps with `pnpm install`.
2. Run Storybook locally via `pnpm dev` and browse `http://localhost:6006`.
3. Explore stories for usage notes, accessibility guidance (addon-a11y), docs, and interactive controls.

## Components inside

Components are located in the `src/components` folder. You can use them as you would any other React component. Just copy and paste the component you want to use to your project and check that you have the necessary dependencies installed.
